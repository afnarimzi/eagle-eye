This project develops a proof-of-concept for an onboard, real-time computer vision system designed to detect birds, track their 3D movement, and predict potential mid-air collisions with UAVs and and validate UAV missions using GPS waypoints and coordinate transformations across WGS84, ECEF, NED, and FRD frames
